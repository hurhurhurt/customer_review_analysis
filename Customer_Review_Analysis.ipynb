    "Recently, many of my friends have become interested in developing their own apps in the hope that it could generate some cash on the side. However, many of them became worried on how to properly evaluate their app reviews, and whether \"ratings\" on the app store truly captured the overall sentiment expressed by the reviews that users gave. I decided to develop a machine learning model trained on 10k positive reviews and 10k negative reviews in order to provide a basis for sentiment review analysis.\n",

    "Text Analysis in particular is one of the parts of machine learning that needs to be carefully handled, since the data is almost entirely string-based (which most models don't work as well with). We will be cleaning the data by standardizing all rows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove all punctuation\n",
    "    - We don't have a need for periods, semicolons, colons, commas, etc because they don't provide much to the overall meaning of each sentence.\n",
    "- Lowercase everything\n",
    "    - Some people use all caps, and although that does generally indicate that a review is more negative, we are more focused on the overall meaning of the sentence, not its casing.\n",
    "- Remove stop words\n",
    "    - Stop words are words that provide no value to the meaning of the sentence (aka filler words). For example, \"a, and, but\" etc.\n",
    "- Word Tokenization\n",
    "    - Helps the model better understand the data by separating words into separate entities rather than as a whole\n",
    "- Lemmetization \n",
    "    - People's usage of tenses varies: sometimes people write a review in present tense, sometimes they write a review in past tense, etc. Reducing each word to its base should standardize the data to allow for more accuracy by making each word more impactful.\n",
